/// Provides an easy access to a bitmap version of the publication cover.
///
/// While at first glance, getting the cover could be seen as a helper, the implementation
/// actually depends on the publication format:
///
///  - Some might allow vector images or even HTML pages, in which case they need to be converted
///    to bitmaps.
///  - Others require to render the cover from a specific file format, e.g. PDF.
///
/// Furthermore, a reading app might want to use a custom strategy to choose the cover image, for
/// example by:
///
/// - iterating through the images collection for a publication parsed from an OPDS 2 feed
/// - generating a bitmap from scratch using the publication's title
/// - using a cover selected by the user

    /// using `UIScreen.main.bounds.size`.
